      <summary>Qualifications</summary>
      <p>I scored a 1580 on the SAT on my first attempt, with a perfect score (800) in math and 780 in English. I didn't spend hours studying vocabulary or reviewing formulas; I just had <strong>a good strategy</strong> for taking the test and had <strong>clear principles</strong> going into it, which enabled me to answer the questions quickly, correctly, and without stress. Learn and practice the same methods in this course.</p>

Add your schedule availability <a target="_blank" href="https://www.when2meet.com/?31271366-x53cb">here</a>, and I'll find and communicate possible meeting times with you. <em>For now, meetings will be online, though I may open in-person slots later on.</em> After confirming and paying, you will start classes, which will consist of small group sessions online, likely one hour long, office hours, and assignments on either Canvas/Google Classroom. We will also have a student group chat (using the Google Chat platform), and students can message me there at any time; I'm active on Google Chat and will respond soon.</p>

      <summary>What's in a Class?</summary>
      <p>Here is some information on the class structure. This will be flexible, and I'll keep adjusting it to best suit my students, but tentatively, regular small-group online classes will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lecture time, covering key concepts to know for the test</li>
        <li>Strategy discussion, going over best practices for the test</li>
        <li>Instructed problem solving time, demonstrations of a few sample questions being solved, making use of good test-taking and problem-solving strategies</li>
        <li>Group activites, like Kahoots to encourage friendly competition and help with speed in question-solving</li>
        <li>Homework/resource descriptions, assigning resources to review on Google Classroom/Canvas and providing additional practice problems (or assessments, every once in a while) to check for understanding</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Office hours will be Q&A sessions and times for more personalized coaching, although they will be limited. More specific, individual questions can be asked on Google Chat, where I respond quickly. The Canvas/Google Classroom resource will have lecture content, like slides, vocabulary lists, etc. and will also host quizzes and home practice material.</p>
