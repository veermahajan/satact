      <summary>About Me</summary>
      <p>Hi! I'm Veer Mahajan, a rising junior in Fremont, California. I started tutoring in middle school online on Schoolhouse.world (<a target="_blank" href="https://schoolhouse.world/transcript/5bc94629-5570-4fa4-a9e6-6a14c24d870e">my portfolio</a>) and realized it was rewarding and enjoyable for me, which prompted me to continue. Since then, I've focused more on one-on-one and small group tutoring on other online and offline platforms, including various school clubs and international organizations. My primary focus in teaching has been math, particularly from a contest math perspective, and I enjoy working through problems from the AMC 10/12, AIME, HMMT, CML, ARML, and other exams.</p>
